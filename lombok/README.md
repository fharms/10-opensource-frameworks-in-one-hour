# Simple Project Lombok demo examples

This example takes a look at how-to use some of the basic code-generation capabilities of Project Lombok.

## Run

For building the code, please use:

    mvnw install

For running the application, open the project in your IDE, and then run the Java application:

* `Application`

The interesting part of the codebase is however using the Lombok-enhanced code (from your IDE), auto-completing, or inspecting
the disassembled byte-code by using a tool like `javap`.
